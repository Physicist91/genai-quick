# Overview
Quick implementation of some Generative AI applications, along with some useful tools for modern data science.

## Open-source Generative AI applications

In this repo, you can find notebooks for:
1. A text summarizer using BART
2. A conversational chatbot using an open-source model based on the transformer architecture from Meta
3. A translator capable of handling 200 different languages using the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) model from Meta
4. A sound classifier using a CLAP (Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining) model.

## Data Science Tool Stack

Powerful tools and libraries for productivity.

## Winglang

[Winglang](https://github.com/winglang/wing) is an open-source programming language that abstracts away the differences between cloud providers by providing a standard infrastructural API. Winglang expresses both infrastructure and application logic in a safe and unified programming model with two execution phases:
1. *preflight* for infrastructure definitions
2. *inflight* for runtime code

## Pigeon

[Pigeon](https://github.com/agermanidis/pigeon) is an open-source annotation tool. One can annotate the dataset by simply defining buttons and labeling samples, as demonstrated below.

## Mito

[Mito](https://docs.trymito.io/getting-started/installing-mito) is a no-code data analysis tool with spreadhsheet interface in Jupyter Notebook. Each edit in the spreadsheet will also generate the equivalent Python code.

## Drawdata

[Drawdata](https://github.com/koaning/drawdata) allows you to draw a dataset in Jupyter notebook by dragging the mouse.

## PyGWalker

[PyGWalker](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker) allows you to open a Tableau-style interface for visual analysis. Note that Graphic Walker is an open-source alternative to Tableau.
