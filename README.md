# Overview
Quick implementation of some Generative AI applications, along with some useful tools for modern data science.

## Open-source Generative AI applications

In this repo, you can find notebooks for:
1. A text summarizer using BART
2. A conversational chatbot using an open-source model based on the transformer architecture from Meta
3. A translator capable of handling 200 different languages using the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) model from Meta
4. A sound classifier using a CLAP (Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining) model.
